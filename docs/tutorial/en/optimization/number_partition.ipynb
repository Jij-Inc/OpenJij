    "# Number Partitioning\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we show how to solve the number partitioning problem using OpenJij, [JijModeling](https://www.ref.documentation.jijzept.com/jijmodeling/), and [JijModeling Transpiler](https://www.ref.documentation.jijzept.com/jijmodeling-transpiler/).

    "## Overview of the Number Partitioning Problem\n",
    "Number partitioning is the problem of dividing a given set of numbers into two subsets such that the sum of the numbers is equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us have a set of numbers $A=\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n",
    "It is easy to divide this set into equal sums: $\\{1, 4\\}, \\{2, 3\\}$ and the sum of each subset is 5.\n",
    "Thus, when the size of the set is small, the answer is relatively easy to obtain.\n",
    "When the problem is large, however, it is not immediately solvable.\n",
    "Here, we solve this problem using annealing."

    "The problem is to find $x_i$ that satisfies the constraint.\n",
